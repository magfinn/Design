      Mother of two, lover of outdoor adventures, and current student of UC Davis Coding Bootcamp. I have spent the last 10 years working for nonprofits serving homeless, low-income and at-risk populations in Sacramento and the Bay Area. In nonprofits, you often wear many hats. 5 years ago my attention turned to tech when I "inherited" a role as Salesforce Administrator. I spent the next year getting the system up and running and have continued working on and improving it ever since. I have experienced a disconnect that can take place in not-for-profit organizations between the technology that is available, and the time and expertise needed to utilize these tools to their full capacity. I am motivated to help bridge this gap for organizations making a difference in the community - providing the technical support they need to continue their hard and much needed work.
